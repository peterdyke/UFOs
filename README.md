# UFOs
## Project Overview
Given a Javascript array filled with information about UFO sightings across the United States and Canada. The data array contains dates, citites, and descriptions of the event, among other categories. We created a website to display this data, give background on UFO sightings, and gave the user the ability to filter through the data on a number of fields.

## Resources
Data Source: data.js Software Used: Virtual Studio Code 1.57.0

## Results
To build site and to add filterable data I first added the list items in the html code to build the framework of where the filterable fields will go. You can see that code below.

Then in our app.js file we wrote a script to filter the table and display the filtered results. That code is below.

Now when we go to our webpage we see our main data, and on the left side of the page there are five filterable fields where we can enter values and displayed data will match those of the selected filters.

## Summary

While our website functions just as we want it to, we need to clean up the  comment section of the data array. There are unneccessary symbols and typos in the comments that make the data harder to parse and understand. We also could include some more interactivity and links to other sites with more information on UFO sightings.
